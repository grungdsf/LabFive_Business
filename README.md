# Business Card App
I made the business card project given in the 'Android Basics with Compose' course
offered by Google. I used Column and Row elements in this Project

• Column element is used to place our items vertically on the screen.\
• Row element allows us to place items horizontally on the screen.\
• Spacer to create the space between the contact details and the main content.\
• In built icons from the android studio for the phone, mail and share icon.\
